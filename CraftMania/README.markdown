CraftMania is my open-source game. It is supposed to look like Minecraft by Mojang. I am trying to make the game as close as possible to Minecraft. 
Before I made my source public, I asked on [StackExchange](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/22247/am-i-allowed-to-make-my-minecraft-clone-open-source) if it is actually legal to do so. 
The answer was yes, as long as I don't use the name Minecraft and do not use any assets created by Mojang. So right now, all the source code 
is available at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcourteaux/CraftMania)! You can also visit the [blog](http://2dbrothers.comuf.com/wordpress)!

I started the game in Java from scratch using some code snippets by Benjamin Glatzel for the advanced mathematical techniques he used in his
game called [Terasology](http://blog.movingblocks.net/blockmania/). I'm using OpenGL through [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/).


Setup
-----

You will need Oracle's [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](http://www.java.com/de/download/). You should be sure that your Graphics Card (GPU) driver is up to date.
It is recommended to take a look at "conf/conf.txt" and set the values you think are the best for your machine.


Run the Game
------------

You can simply double click the CraftMania.jar file when you installed Oracle's JVM.

Controls
--------

 * [Z,Q,S,D] or [Q,W,A,S]	Walking. Choose your Keyboard layout in "conf/conf.txt"
 * [Space] 					Jump.
 * [Left click]				Place the block in your hand.
 * [Right click]			Destroy the block on which you are aiming.
 * [F]						Toggle God-mode.
 * [E]						Open your inventory.
 * [O]						Toggle overlay rendering.
 * [L]						Place or remove a lightpoint (you should use torches, in fact :D)

Texture Pack
------------

I'm using the awesome <strong><a href="http://www.carrotcakestudios.co.uk/gmcraft/">Good Morning Craft!</a></strong> texture pack by Louis Durrant.
Of course, this is a texture pack developed for Minecraft by Mojang. So, you might try his texture pack for Minecraft. Make sure you take a look at it!
